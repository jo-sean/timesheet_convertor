# timesheet_convertor
Converts CSV to the wanted format.


All files included in the folder should remain for the program to function properly.

venv folder
.gitignore
README.md (so there are instructions)
run_convertor.bat (to run the program easily)

There are two files that may be located. The first is the exported csv file: Work Session.csv. 
This file will always export to that name, so every Monday or whenever this file is exported from the 
website: https://phillipstown-my.sharepoint.com/personal/dominic_phillipstown_org_nz/Lists/Work%20Session/AllItems.aspx
it will come out as: Work Session.csv

With this file, you will move it to the folder containing the program and is named "timesheet_convertor". 
From here, it is as simple as double clicking the "run_convertor.bat" file. This will create a new csv that is 
formated and has the appropriate totals calculated. The name will show up as "Timesheet_week_of_YYYY-MM-DD"

The format for the csv is the following for one user.
